This project is based on using basic feedforward neural networks, without CNNs, Keras or TensorFlow to recognise digits.
- This model is trained on the popular MNIST dataset
- Loss function/ Cost function: Cross-Entropy
- Output function: Softmax

P.S. This project simulates the working of a CNN, but does not use artificial neurons at any step, including backpropagation. All operations are matrix-based only.
